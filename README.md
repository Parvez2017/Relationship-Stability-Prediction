A python Machine Learning project based on the dataset "How Couples Meet and Stay Together" from the survey undertaken by Stanford University. This dataset basically has a number of features and the relationship status of the couples. It's an area of social science research. I tried to apply some Machine learning concepts including various feature selection and extraction techniques to find the best features to predict the relationship stability of the couple. 

The used Machine Learning techniques are-

Feature Selection Methods

1. Chi-Square Based Feature Selection

2. Mutual Information Based Feature Selection

3. Spearman's Correlation Based Feature Selection

Feature Extraction Methods

1. Reverse Features Extraction(RFE)

2. Reverse Features Extraction with Cross-Validation(RFECV)

Classification Algorithms

1. Extra Tree classifier

2. Decision Tree

3. QDA

4. KNN

5. Bagging

6. Adaboost

7. MLP

8. Gradient boosting

9. NuSVC

10. LightGBM

11. Catboost

12. XGboost

13. Bernoulli Naive Bayes

14. Gaussian Naive Bayes

15. Decision Tree
