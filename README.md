A python Machine Learning project based on the dataset "How Couples Meet and Stay Together" from the survey undertaken by Stanford University. This dataset basically has a number of features and the relationship status of the couples. It's an area of social science research. I tried to apply some Machine learning concepts including various feature selection and extraction techniques to find the best features to predict the relationship stability of the couple. 

The used Machine Learning techniques are-

Feature Selection Methods

Chi-Square Based Feature Selection

Mutual Information Based Feature Selection

Spearman's Correlation Based Feature Selection

Feature Extraction Methods

Reverse Features Extraction(RFE)

Reverse Features Extraction with Cross-Validation(RFECV)

Classification Algorithms

Extra Tree classifier

Decision Tree

QDA

KNN

Bagging

Adaboost

MLP

Gradient boosting

NuSVC

LightGBM

Catboost

XGboost

Bernoulli Naive Bayes

Gaussian Naive Bayes

Decision Tree
